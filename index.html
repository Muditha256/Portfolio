            <p>Debugging and testing are complementary processes that ensure software programs run as they should. After
              writing a complete section or part of a code, programmers test to identify bugs and errors. Once bugs are
              found, coders can begin the process of debugging and work towards ridding software of any errors.</p>

            <p>Responsive design ensures a consistent brand experience and interface across different devices. Users can
              easily recognize and navigate a website, regardless of the device they use. This consistency builds trust
              and fosters familiarity, leading to better user engagement and conversions.</p>

              progress in the last five years. Talking to colleagues in other departments to understand how a problem is
              affecting their team. Setting up an informational interview with an outside expert.</p>

            <p>Analytical skills are problem-solving skills that help you parse data and information to develop
              creative, rational solutions. An analytical person in the workplace focuses on making sense of the facts
              and figures and using logical thinking practices to identify a fix.</p>

        <p style="margin-left: 160px;">In closing I would first like to thank you for visiting my ePortfolio, I have spent many hours finishing this
          project and have taken much pride in putting it together to share with you.<br> I believe that all of my work
          presented in this portfolio shows my accomplishments that I have worked on and how they go to show how I
          strive to assist other people in their lives.</p>

      <div class="row">
        <p style="margin-left: 160px;">Whether it is a small impact or large, my goal is to leave everyone I meet with a positive impression. I
          believe that I have begun to achieve this goal because when I am meeting<br> people or talking to people I am
          really beginning to focus more on them and that they are doing. I have also been for devoted to my projected
          more than ever before.</p>
      </div>

      <br>

      <div class="row">
        <p style="margin-left: 160px;">I also believe that the work samples shown on this website have given you the opportunity to see how my
          education and research have assisted me in getting me where I am today in<br> my career and why I have chosen the
          take a role in my career where I can hopefully make some sort of an impact on peopleâ€™s lives. As I said in my
          philosophy statement I want to be<br> able to teach and learn from others as I believe that ongoing lifelong
          learning is very important.</p>
      </div>

      <br>

      <div class="row">
        <p style="margin-left: 160px;">What I learned from this process is that a lot of the work I have been doing and projects that I have been
          working on personally are very mush associated with what I personally enjoy<br> the most. This is good because I
          think that this will give me an opportunity to really work hard and be very creative and committed in my
          career.</p>

          The most prominent reading was by far Bunn's "How to Read Like a Writer" due to its heavy implications that
          would be carried throughout the quarter and beyond. We read this<br> during the first week of the quarter as it
          would be utilized with every upcoming assignment. In the article, Bunn stresses that when reading something,
          one should try to find out<br> "how the text is constructed" so that they can learn how to replicate that
          technique in their writing. This technique proved to be extraordinarily helpful when writing my future
          projects,<br> especially writing project 2. Like I said when I first read the piece, I believe we have all done
          this to extent on a subconscious level, as we tend to pick up on things when reading <br>without ever realizing
          it. Furthermore, when one becomes actively aware of what they are doing, they can sort through components more
          effectively to make their own writing <br>stronger. After reading the article and practicing RLW, I have now
          conditioned myself to proactively search for methods that writers use so that I can make my writing better.<br>
          This is demonstrated wonderfully in my work as my work has significantly improved as a result of using RLW
          over the past several weeks.

          What I got most out of this class was my understanding of how I have changed as a writer and how I have grown
          as a result. As aforementioned, coming into this class I was rather<br> inexperienced with writing, as evident by
          the fact that I had only written two essays prior to starting this class. The most important realization,
          however, came at the beginning during<br> writing project 1. This is not that surprising as we had to create a
          profile of ourselves as writers which forced us to really dig deep and think about who we are as it pertains
          to writing.<br> My ah-ha moment came when I was generating my focus - we are all writers. This epiphany was so
          incredibly important because I carried it with me through all of my writing<br> assignments. I used to have the
          notion that because I am a STEM major, I automatically had to be bad at writing. Yet I realized that we are
          all writers, and much like riding a bicycle,<br> even if we haven't done it in a while, we haven't lost the
          ability to write. I used this notion whenever I wrote as a means of a confidence boost and a reminder to be
          confident in my work.<br> Even if I felt that it might not necessarily be my best work, I had to stand by my work
          and be proud of it. And when you really think about it, this rationale goes beyond writing; it carries<br> with
          you with whatever challenge you have to tackle next. I also learned that we aren't perfect, our writing can
          always be improved and we have to be open to change. We can always<br> make something better and when someone
          critiques it or offers advice, you should take it as a means to improve yourself.
